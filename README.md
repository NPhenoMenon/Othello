# Othello

This program allows the user to play the Othello or Reversi game. It is a strategy-based board game played by 2 players on an 8Ã—8 board. Each player must play either white or black.

If u want more information on this game, you can refer to this website:

This program has additional options for each player. Each player can either place a piece on the board or press the AI button to place a piece for them. I have made a greedy AI system which captures the greatest number of pieces in a turn.
